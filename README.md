# Vonage cURL Examples

<img src="https://developer.nexmo.com/assets/images/Vonage_Nexmo.svg" height="48px" alt="Nexmo is now known as Vonage" />

This repository is a collection of cURL code snippets, demonstrating the functionality of the [Vonage APIs](https://developer.nexmo.com). The code snippets are used in the developer documentation, such as in [Send a Unicode SMS](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/code-snippets/send-an-sms-with-unicode).

## Pre-requisites

You will need [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) installed.

If you don't have a Vonage API account, you'll need to [create one](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up)!

### Snippets That Use a JWT

Some use JWT for authentication. These snippets will `source` the `jwt.sh` file, and the cURL request will contain the following header:

```curl
-H 'Authorization: Bearer '$JWT
```

The `jwt.sh` file will generate a JWT for you using the values from the `VONAGE_APPLICATION_ID` and 
`VONAGE_PRIVATE_KEY` in your `config.sh` file. In order for `jwt.sh` to function, you must have the latest [Vonage CLI]
(https://github.com/vonage/vonage-cli) installed locally. You can install it in the following way:

```
npm install -g @vonage/cli
```

## Configuration

You can find the API key and secret for your configuration settings in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).

This repository contains a main configuration file `config.sh` that is referenced by the code snippets. You can directly edit the `config.sh` file to add your information. Alternatively, you can create a `config.local.sh` file, which overrides the main configuration file. This allows you to keep your specific information separate from the main configuration.

Note: If you copy `config.sh` to `config.local.sh` make sure to remove the following lines from the bottom of the `config.local.sh` file:

```bash
CONFIG_DIR=$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")
if [ -f "$CONFIG_DIR/config.local.sh" ]; then
    source "$CONFIG_DIR/config.local.sh"
fi
```

Some APIs use JWT authentication. For these, an Application ID and Private Key will be needed instead of you API key and secret. You can create a Vonage Application in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/applications) in order to generate the Application ID and Private Key.

### Setting the Private Key Variable

When setting the `VONAGE_PRIVATE_KEY` environement variable, copy your `private.key` file to the root directory and use an absolute path for the variable value, e.g. `"/home/user/private.key"`

## Run the code snippets

As each code snippet requires access to the configuration files, you must run them from the directory they reside in, for example:

``` shell
cd messaging/sms/
./send-an-sms.sh
```
